# Clash of Clans Upgrade Times

This project is just a simple spreadsheet of all the upgrade times in Clash of Clans cuz there isn't really an accessible one other than the Wiki.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get the application up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, navigate into the project's directory in your terminal and install all the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will typically launch the application in your web browser. You can usually access it at http://localhost:5173, or your terminal will indicate the specific address if a different port is used.
